	<h2>Why I started reading</h2>

<p>I have a friend who really enjoys reading and she encouraged me to start</p>
<p> I have always loved fantasy stories with an intersting plots but I was turned away from books because I don't like violence</p>
<p>I had a hard time at highschool in year 7 - 9 and when I started reading it gave me an escape to use to get away from life</p>
