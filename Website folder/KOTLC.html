	<h2>BrIef summary</h2>
<p>"Keeper of the Lost Cities" by Shannon Messenger follows the story of Sophie Foster, a twelve-year-old girl with telepathic abilities who discovers she's actually an elf living among humans. She's whisked away to the magical world of the elves, where she learns about her true identity, her extraordinary abilities, and the complex political and social dynamics of the elven society. Throughout the series, Sophie navigates friendships, alliances, and enemies while unraveling the mysteries of her past and trying to find her place in a world where she doesn't quite fit in. Along the way, she uncovers dark secrets, faces dangerous adversaries, and ultimately plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of both the elven world and her own destiny.</p>

	<p>Sophie Foster learns that she is part of an ambitious and secretive project known as "Project Moonlark." This revelation comes later in the series as Sophie delves deeper into her origins and the mysteries surrounding her past. Project Moonlark was initiated by the Black Swan, a clandestine organization dedicated to bringing about positive change in the elven world and opposing the corrupt forces within it, including the Neverseen. The goal of Project Moonlark was to create a child with unprecedented magical potential who could potentially change the course of history and bring about a brighter future for the elves. Sophie discovers that she is the result of Project Moonlark and that her creation involved complex genetic engineering and manipulation. She possesses a unique combination of abilities, including telepathy, telekinesis, and other magical powers, making her one of the most powerful individuals in the elven world.</p>
